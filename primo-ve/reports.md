# Reports

Each campus is able to run its own reports of Primo activities.

## **Primo Back Office**

To access the reports, you must log into the Primo back office with your library's credentials \(provided below\):  
 [https://cuny-lb.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com:1443](https://cuny-lb.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com:1443)

**NB**: This site is accessible only from on-campus. Please ensure OLS has your correct and up-to-date [IP information](https://ols-support.cuny.edu/?q=libraries/ip-ranges).

After you log in, click on "Primo Analytics." While in the "Catalog" \(_see_: menu in the top right\), use the navigation pane in the left-hand column to get around. In Shared Folders &gt; Primo &gt; Usage &gt; Reports, you will find several sample reports.

### **Customizing Reports**

Using the "More" option below the report name, you can "Copy" a report, go into "My Folders," and "Paste" the report. From "My Folders," you can freely edit and customize the local report from a shared example template.

Please **DO NOT** edit reports in the "Shared Folders" section as this will edit the report for everyone at CUNY! \(And there's no "undo" in Primo Analytics!\)

## **Documentation**
