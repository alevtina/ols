# About

The CUNY Libraries' discovery tool, Primo VE, is developed by Ex Libris. It is integrated tightly with Almaâ€”so much so that it is managed within Alma.

Primo VE is maintained on behalf of the CUNY Libraries by the Office of Library Services staff in close cooperation with the Public Services Committee. It is branded as "OneSearch" in CUNY.

The CUNY-wide instance is available at the following URL:  
[https://onesearch.cuny.edu/primo-explore/search?vid=CUNY](https://onesearch.cuny.edu/primo-explore/search?vid=CUNY)

A non-production \("sandbox"\) instance of OneSearch is also available:  
[https://cuny-primosb.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?vid=CUNY](https://cuny-primosb.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?vid=CUNY)

Each campus has its own instance, or "view," that reflects their local holdings. To view yours, replace the "CUNY" as the `vid` \(view ID\) with your [2-letter campus code](https://ols-support.cuny.edu/?q=libraries/own-codes) \(in lowercase letters\).
